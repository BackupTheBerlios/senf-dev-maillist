<PRE>Hi everyone,

I just had a discussion about the ClientSocketHandle interface with
Phillip. Specifically, we have been talking about some of the read() /
readfrom() overloads. Each of read() and readfrom() has lots of
overloads, of which 

 * one reads data into an EXISTING range WITHOUT changing the size of
   the range.

 * another one reads data into a container which is RESIZED to match
   the amount of data read.

Thr problem is, that these overloads are differentiated by the
presence of the 'limit' argument. The rationale is, that when reading
into an existing range, the limit argument is not needed since the
limit is automatically given by the size of the range.

  std::vector&lt;boost::uint8_t&gt; data (100u);

  // Read up to 100 chars into existing range
  std::vector&lt;boost::uint8_t&gt;::iterator end = socket.read( data );

  // Read up to 100 chars of data into vector changing it's size accordingly
  socket.read( data, 100u );

we often don't want to specify a limit. This is achieved by specifying
0u for the limit

  socket.reaad( data, 0u );

but instead, it is very easy to accidentaly write

  socket.read( data );

This will call the range overload since EVERY container is also a
range. When the container is empty, the range is empty and no data
will be read since the maximum number of chars to read is given by the
size of the range.

I propose the following solution: We add an additional disambiguating
argument:

 // Read data into existing range
 socket.read( data, senf::ReadIntoRange );

 // Read data and resize container accordingly. No size limit
 socket.read( data, senf::ResizeContainer )

 // Read max 100 chars into data
 socket.read( data, senf::ResizeContainer, 100u );

(I hate to put the sybols directly into the senf namespace but placing
them into the ClientSocketHandle class is quite awkward too since that
is a tmeplate class. I really should have used senf::socket for the
socket library ... it's to late for this now ...)

This change will break existing code but I think, this is justified
since the code is much more readable and removes above ambiguity.
