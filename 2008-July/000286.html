<PRE>Hi SENFistas,

after the last discussion on API breakage, here a rundown of the
upcoming changes in the Scheduler. I really need fast feedback since I
have a bad feeling to continue working on the stuff uncommitted ...

The Scheduler has been completely re-implemented. The outside API has
been kept as close to the original API as possible. The
senf::Scheduler class is however a wrapper around a number of new
modular classes. 

 - The scheduler is now basically extensible with new types of
   events. They still need to be integrated into the senf::Scheduler
   but this should prove much simpler than trying to unravel the
   old process() function.

 - The scheduler now makes use of a very simple but real task
   scheduler (FIFORunner) which is responsible for scheduling the
   execution of signaled callbacks. This ensures, that callbacks are
   called fairly.

 - All timing (the timeout's and the ClockService) is now based on
   POSIX timers. Those are highly accurate (the linux implementation
   is accurate to the nanosecond disregarding scheduling latency and
   execution time). Especially this allows timeout's to be signaled
   with a precision above the kernels HZ value on modern linux
   kernels with high resolution timer support.

If this would have been the original Scheduler implementation, we
would not have add()/remove(), timeout/cancelTimeout() and so on, we
would have objects which constructors register and destructors
unregister a callback. This would be MUCH safer and probably simpler,
but I did not want to break everything using the Scheduler in such a
fundamental way (we may come back to this later).

The only API changes are:

 - The signature of a file-descriptor callback has been changed:

       OLD: void (EventId) 
       NEW: void (int)

   This change was already pending for some time since the argument is
   NOT an EventId but a bitmask of several EventId's (which lead to
   the use of ugly type casts throughout).

 - The signature of a signal callback has been changed:

       OLD: void ()
       NEW: void (siginfo_t const &amp;)

   The siginfo_t structure is from POSIX and is e.g. documented in the
   sigaction(2) man-page.

 - The timeout parameters are now obsolte:

       REMOVED: timeoutEarly(...)
       REMOVED: timeoutAdjust(...)

   The members are still in the API for a transitional period but they
   are no-op's and produce a log message when called. The timeouts are
   now 


It is very difficult to add backward compatibility code vor the first
two points. Therefore when these changes are committed, things WILL
certainly break, so be prepared, the changes to your code should
really be minimal.
