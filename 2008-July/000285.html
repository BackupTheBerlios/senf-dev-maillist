<PRE>Hi SENFistas,

(didn't we use englisch on this list ?)

While fixing the timer/logger deadlock problem, I am in the midst of a
complete Scheduler rewrite. This single monolithic beast needs to be
replaced ... I don't want to try and implement the new POSIX timer
infrastructure which goes with the ClockService update in the old
Scheduler.

The reimplementation is already almost complete. However, there is
one Problem:

POSIX timers work by sending a custom signal to the process when a
timer expires. The new scheduler (to be more precise, the
TimerDispatcher) manages a single such timer and therefore needs one
unix signal. The question is: which one?

 - there are quite a number of realtime signals. Howver, those are
   used at least partially when going multithreaded.

 - realtime signals have the property, that they can be queued more
   than once to the same process. Therfore no signal will get lost but
   the handler might be called multiple times in sucession if the
   signal was delivered multiple times while the signal was blocked

 - non-realtime signals there are only two custom: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
   and those are often used for other purposes (e.g. reopening
   logfiles and such).

 - The SIGALRM signal is of little use when the Scheduler is in
   use. However, SIGALRM is hardcoded in some syscalls and there are
   some funny interactions (which should be no problem since use of
   the corresponding functions makes no sense together with the
   Scheduler, but such problems would be very hard to debug).

The implementation does not require the use of realtime signals, even
more, it is more efficient when not using realtime signals.

SIGUSR2 is already used when using senf::Deamon in debug mode to
generate a stack trace.

SIGUSR1 is pending to be used in senf::Daemon to rotate the console
log.

So at the moment, I tend to use SIGALRM which is of little use
otherwise and hope, that nobody in one's right mind would ever use a
syscall which mucks araound with SIGALRM directly or indirectly.

I'll commit this with SIGALRM now. This can be changed easily.

stefan.
