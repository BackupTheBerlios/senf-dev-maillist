<PRE>Hi all, 

I would like to close the finalize topic that's why I start with my proposal: 

We all agree that we would like to have two finalize-functions: 

finalizeThis()
finalizeAll()

I don't think we need finalizeRange(P1, P2) but we should discuss this. 

But I definitly would name all of them other than simply finalize() because:
1. this makes us all to decide on the right function call in the existing 
code. For the code at us this won't be the finalizeAll call in most / all 
cases
2. this makes it clear what exactly this call will do. 


Opinions, comments to this proposal?



to the discussion: 
This implementation will prevent that finalizeAll will create correct packets 
in the meaning of the module (of course the packets will be correct 
themselves).
Please have a look at some examples we have been discussing internally. I 
attached an pdf from Thorsten. 

1. The first example comes from the Daidalos software and this code had the 
problem with the UDP-Checksum-Bug: it should tunnel ethernet packets 
transparently. I don't want packets to be fixed / altered at all. 
This could be perfectly done with finalizeThis 

2. NAT of a simple packet:
perfectly done with finalizeAll(), you could think, but be carefull, have a 
look at example 3

3. NAT of a complex packet with GRE, IP, UDP: 
finalizeAll() would in this case destroy the transparency of the GRE 
tunneling.
Because of this NAT could not be done with the proposed solution without a big 
switch statement
The main drawback of this: the knowledge, if further header could depend on 
GRE or the even outer packets should not be in the NAT modules ( in all 
modules which have such a functionality).

4. IP-independent Extension Header
these would increase the complexity of a more intelligent solution: although 
the ext. header does not depend on the IP header the following header does. 

5. IP-dependent extension header zB Authentication Header
there could be several header depend on one IP header

6. several IP header: 
the depending packets have to choose the correct IP header if there are 
several. 
This issue is independent from the finalize() solution

Conclusion: 
The only case which would cause trouble and we can think of right now is 
changing the IP header which is called NAT normally. I don't think this is a 
expeceted application of SENF so we should go for the double-finalize 
described at the beginning. 

Best Regards, 
David
