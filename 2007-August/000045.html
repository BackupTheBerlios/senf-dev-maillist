<PRE>Debian packaging
----------------

I hope, we now have a complete workflow for building debian
packages. I have attached a build-log for a complete debian
build. There is still one problem: For some reason, the object files
are rebuilt before installing them. I have no idea why but it's not a
real problem.

The other problem is the location of the include files. At the moment,
they are directly installed in /usr/include. The should be placed into
/usr/include/senf, the problem however is, that all cross-module
include path-names in the library are absolute path names *without*
the 'senf' prefix. Restructuring the source to include a 'senf'
directory is a *lot* of work since it affects the build process.

Placing the include files into a 'senf' subdirectory and adding
'-I/usr/include/senf' to the compile commands is no solution either,
it does not solve the collision conflict.

So I propose to change all includes within the SENF library to
*relative* includes. I would also provide (automatically generated)
include files /usr/include/senf/&lt;package&gt;.hh for PPI, Socket and
Packets. For Scheduler and Utils this does not make so much sense. 


SENF Status
-----------

I would describe the current status of SENF as 'ready for experimental
use'. All the important functionality is there but additional work has
to be done to polish the framework:

 - At least some implementation of the Logger.

 - A library for parsing simple configuration files and command-line
   options (may be just a thin wrapper around Boost.Program_options)

 - A simple framework for managing daemon applications, like safe
   forking, allowing the forked daemon to communicate startup failure
   to the parent, maybe automatic application-restart on catastrophic
   failure etc.

 - Additional more flexible macros for writing packet parsers. After I
   have finally solved the biggest hurdle for implementing those
   macros (see Utils/mpl.hh, the SENF_MPL_SLOT_* macros), a very much
   more flexible and simpler implementation of those macros should be
   streight forward. This should help implementing new packet types a
   lot.

 - We need at least rudimentary signal handling in the scheduler (to
   handle graceful shutdown of daemon processes).

I think, some of this work is also relevant for Daidalos and can save
lot's of debugging work later on.
